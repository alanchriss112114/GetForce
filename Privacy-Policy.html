                            <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful has always been core to everything we do at Getforce. It’s why we make so many of our products, accessible and free of charge to everyone.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">Building for the web is a rocky adventure. It's hard enough to build a top-notch web app that nails performance and uses all the latest best practices. It's even harder to keep that experience great over time. As your project evolves, developers come on board, new features land, and the codebase grows. That Great Experience ™ you once achieved may begin to deteriorate and UX starts to suffer! Feature Policy is designed to keep you on track.With Feature Policy, you opt-in to a set of "policies" for the browser to enforce on specific features used throughout your site. These policies restrict what APIs the site can access or modify the browser's default behavior for certain features.</p>
                            <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Policies are a contract between developer and users.</span>They inform the browser about what the developer's intent is and thus, help keep us honest when our app tries to go off the rails and do something bad. If the site or embedded third-party content attempts to violate any of the developer's preselected rules, the browser overrides the behavior with better UX or blocks the API altogether.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Getforce Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal; font-size: large;">Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>

                            <p class="con scon">We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal; font-size: large;">We collect information in the following ways:</p>

When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Getforce Profile, which may include your name and photo.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Information we get from your use of our services.</span> We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</li>

                                    <li class="con scon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-small;">Device information</li>
                                    <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-small;">We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Getforce may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Getforce Account.</p>
                                    <li class="con scon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-small;">Log information</li>
                                    <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-small;">When you use our services or view content provided by Getforce, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:</p>

                                    <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-small;">When you use Getforce services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Getforce with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
                                    <li class="con scon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-small;">Unique application numbers</li>
                                    <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-small;">Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Getforce when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</p>

We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Getforce features that may appear on other sites. Our Getforce Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Getforce Analytics information is linked, by the Getforce Analytics customer or by Getforce, using Getforce technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.</p>

                            <p class="con scon">We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Getforce and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">We may use the name you provide for your Getforce Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Getforce Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Getforce Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Getforce Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">If you have a Getforce Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Getforce or on third-party applications connected to your Getforce Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Getforce Account.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">When you contact Getforce, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Getforce Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">Getforce processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Review and update your Getforce activity controls to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Getforce services. You can also visit these controls to manage whether certain activity is stored in a cookie or similar technology on your device when you use our services while signed-out of your account.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Review and control certain types of information tied to your Getforce Account by using Getforce Dashboard.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">View and edit your preferences about the Getforce ads shown to you on Getforce and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings.

                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Control who you share information with through your Getforce Account.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Take information associated with your Getforce Account out of many of our services.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Choose whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</li>

                            <p class="con scon">You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.</p>

                        <p class="con scon">As a provider of products and services for many users across the Internet, we recognize how important it is to help protect user privacy and security. We understand that secure products are instrumental in maintaining the trust users place in us and we strive to create innovative products that both serve user needs and operate in the user’s best interest.</p>
                        <p class="con scon">This site provides information for <span style="font-weight: bold;">developers and security professionals.</span></p>
                        <p class="con scon">If you are a Getforce user and have a security issue to report regarding your personal Getforce account, please visit our contact page. To find out how to stay safe online, take the Getforce Security Checkup.</p>
                    </div>  
                    <div>
                        <p class="con lcon">Reporting security issues</p>
                        <p class="con scon">If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in a Getforce product or have a security incident to report, to include it in our Vulnerability Reward Program. Upon receipt of your message we will send an automated reply that includes a tracking identifier. If you feel the need, please use our PGP public key to encrypt your communications with us.</p>
                        <p class="con lcon">Getforce's vulnerability disclosure policy</p>
                        <p class="con scon">We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. Vendors, as well as researchers, must act responsibly. This is why Getforce adheres to a 90-day disclosure deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared in public with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix. That deadline can vary in the following ways:</p>
                    </div> 
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="con scon">If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend or US public holiday, the deadline will be moved to the next normal work day.</li>
                            <li class="con scon">Before the 90-day deadline has expired, if a vendor lets us know that a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day that will fall within 14 days following the deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.</li>
                            <li class="con scon">When we observe a previously unknown and unpatched vulnerability in software under active exploitation (a “0day”), we believe that more urgent action—within 7 days—is appropriate. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more devices or accounts will be compromised. Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information. As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available so that users can take steps to protect themselves.</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p class="con scon">As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme circumstances. We remain committed to treating all vendors strictly equally. Getforce expects to be held to the same standard.</p>
                        <p class="con scon">This policy is strongly in line with our desire to improve industry response times to security bugs, but also results in softer landings for bugs marginally over deadline. We call on all researchers to adopt disclosure deadlines in some form, and feel free to use our policy verbatim if you find our record and reasoning compelling. Creating pressure towards more reasonably-timed fixes will result in smaller windows of opportunity for blackhats to abuse vulnerabilities. In our opinion, vulnerability disclosure policies such as ours result in greater overall safety for users of the Internet. <span id="softwareprinciples"></span></p>

                    <p class="con scon">At Getforce, we put a lot of thought into improving your online experience. We’re alarmed by what we believe is a growing disregard for your rights as computer users. We’ve seen increasing reports of spyware and other applications that trick you in order to serve you pop-up ads or hijack your browser from the site that you’re trying to visit.</p>
                    <p class="con scon">We don't see this trend reversing itself. In fact, it's getting worse. As a provider of services and monetisation for users, advertisers and publishers on the Internet, we feel a responsibility to be proactive about these issues. We've outlined a set of principles that we believe our industry should adopt. We aim to follow these guidelines ourselves with the applications that we distribute. And because we strongly believe that these principles are good for the industry and users worldwide, we encourage our current and prospective business partners to adopt them as well. These guidelines are, by necessity, broad. Software creation and distribution are complex and the technology is continuously evolving. As a result, some useful applications may not comply entirely with these principles and some deceptive practices may not be addressed here. This document is only a start and focuses on the areas of Internet software and advertising. These guidelines need to be continually updated to keep pace with ever-changing technology.</p>
                    <p class="con scon">We look forward to an ongoing discussion with you and with our partners. We'd like to hear your suggestions to improve and update these principles. Share your feedback on our help forum.</p>
                    <p class="con lcon">Principles</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Installation</p>
                    <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">We believe that software should not trick you into installing it.</span>It should be clear to you when you are installing or enabling software on your computer and you should have the ability to say no. An application shouldn’t install itself onto your computer secretly or by hiding within another program that you’re installing or updating. You should be conspicuously notified of the functions of all the applications in a bundle.</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Upfront disclosure</p>
                    <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">When an application is installed or enabled, it should inform you of its principal and significant functions. </span>And if the application makes money by showing you advertising, it should clearly and conspicuously explain this. This information should be presented in a way that a typical user will see and understand – not buried in small print that requires you to scroll. For example, if the application is paid for by serving pop-up ads or sending your personal data to a third party, that should be made clear to you.</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Simple removal</p>
                    <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It should be easy for you to figure out how to disable or delete an application.</span> The process should try to remove sufficient components to disable all functions of the application, visible or not, without messing up your computer. Once an application is disabled or deleted, it should not remain active or be enabled automatically later by itself or another application.</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Clear behaviour</p>
                    <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Applications that affect or change your user experience should make it clear that they are the reason for those changes.</span> For example, if an application opens a window, that window should identify the application responsible for it. Applications should not intentionally obscure themselves under multiple or confusing names. You should be given the means to control the application in a straightforward manner, such as by clicking visible elements generated by the application. If an application shows you ads, it should clearly mark them as advertising and inform you that they originate from that application. If an application makes a change designed to affect the user experience of other applications (such as setting your homepage), then those changes should be made clear to you.</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Snooping</p>
                    <p class="con scon"><span style="font-weight: bold;">If an application collects or transmits your personal information such as your address, you should know.</span> We believe you should be asked explicitly for your permission in a manner that is obvious and clearly states what information will be collected or transmitted. For more detail, it should be easy to find a privacy policy that discloses how the information will be used and whether it will be shared with third parties.</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="color: #3c4043; font-weight: normal;">Keeping good company</p>
                    <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold;">Application providers should not allow their products to be bundled with applications that do not meet these guidelines.</p>
                    <p>Many Internet users find that over time their computers become loaded with unwanted software – be it adware, spyware or just plain junk. This is because a few applications that they installed came bundled with junk and that junk generated more junk, piled higher and deeper. We believe any situation where multiple applications are being installed should be made very clear to users, so that if you were to ask them several months later – “What’s this?” – most will know where it came from and why it is there.</p>
                    <p>Usually, there are complex business relationships among the companies participating in a bundle. This can result in well–intentioned companies benefiting from the distribution or revenue generated by software that does not benefit you. Getting paid to distribute or paying money to be distributed with undesirable software enables more undesirable software. Responsible software makers and advertisers can work to prevent such distribution by avoiding these types of business relationships, even if they are through intermediaries.</p>
                    <p>We are alarmed by the size of this problem, which we estimate to be causing hundreds of millions of dollars to change hands annually. Because of this magnitude and user impact, strong action by the industry is imperative.</p>
                    <p>We believe that it is in our users’ and the industry’s interest to work to eliminate this problem. For this reason, we will strive to distribute our software only in bundles where all applications meet the above guidelines and we think users will benefit if others in our industry do the same. <span id="unwantedsoftwarepolicy"></span></p>

In our Software Principles, we provide general recommendations for software that delivers a great user experience. The policy below expands upon those general recommendations by providing a list of basic criteria for user-friendly software on the web. Software that violates these principles is potentially harmful to the user experience, and we will take steps to protect users from it.</p>
                        <p class="con scon" style="font-style: italic;">We’ve found that most unwanted software displays one or more of the same basic characteristics:</p>

                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It tries to trick users into installing it or it piggybacks on the installation of another program.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It doesn’t tell the user about all of its principal and significant functions.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It affects the user’s system in unexpected ways.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It is difficult to remove.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It collects or transmits private information without the user’s knowledge.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">It is bundled with other software and its presence is not disclosed.</li>

                    <div>

                        <p class="con scon" style="font-style: italic;">The software installation process should be straightforward, easy-to-understand and based on clear choices made by the user. It should present a clear value proposition to the user.</p>

                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Programs should have a valid and verified code signature issued by a code-signing authority that presents verifiable publisher information.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Download of the software should only begin when the user has consented to the download by clicking on a clearly-labelled download button.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">At the time of installation, all principal and significant functions of the software should be described in clear and straightforward language that is clearly visible and easy to read on the screen.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">The user must have a meaningful opportunity to review and approve all principal and significant proposed installation options and system changes. For example, at the time of installation, the software might list each of the proposed settings changes, and note that the programme collects the user’s personal data, with links to learn more about each of the changes.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">As part of the install flow, any bundled software must be clearly disclosed. No software should be installed silently without the user’s permission. The name and principal and significant functions of every piece of software that will be installed should be visible to the user, and the user should be able to skip the entire bundled software or offer as well as individual components of the bundle.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Before and during the install process, the software must not engage in any deceptive behaviours. Some examples of deceptive behaviours include:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Making false or misleading claims about the state of the user’s system. For example, misleading claims related to antivirus protection, system performance, system optimisation, a new version of a plug-in, etc.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Claiming or implying to be official software from a company or a partner of the company if that is not the case.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Charging fees for software that is available elsewhere for free without disclosing this to the user and explaining what extra service justifies the fee.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Providing unproven or misleading endorsements.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">The software and download page must contain a link to an End User Licence Agreement (EULA) or Terms of Service (TOS).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Uninstall information must be easily accessible, simple to perform, and clearly identifiable after the software has been installed.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">During the uninstall process, users must be presented with clearly-labelled and prominent instructions that explain how to return their browser’s and/or computer’s user settings to the previous settings.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">The software must provide a clear uninstall process and must not engage in any deceptive behaviours to deter uninstallation. Some examples of deceptive behaviours include:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Making false or misleading claims about potential negative effects on the user’s system or privacy if the software is uninstalled.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Charging fees for software removal.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Including additional prompts or offers that are unnecessary to the uninstall process.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Making the default option in the uninstaller to hide the software instead of removing it.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Uninstallation must not impact unrelated files.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Once software is disabled or deleted, the removal should be complete. Configuration changes that affected the behaviour of already existing software should be reverted. It may not keep any pieces of the software running after uninstallation and must not be automatically enabled later by itself or another programme.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">After installation, the program should not download or install additional software, or make system settings changes, beyond what was offered during the initial installation, unless it is doing so at the explicit, informed direction of the user.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">When accessing Getforce services or products, software must use and adhere to the terms of publicly-available Getforce APIs for interacting with the user’s system or any program installed. In addition, software must comply with any other applicable Getforce policies.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Programs that modify a system's settings must clearly disclose what has changed and how the user can undo it.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">After installation, programs should not engage in deceptive or unexpected behaviour. Some examples of deceptive or unexpected behaviour include:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Displaying false or misleading messages about the system status.</li>

                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Impairing usability of the system. Remapping inputs, unless the program is doing so at the explicit, informed direction of the user.</li>
                                <liv>Preventing the user from controlling the software, or interfering with control of, or access to, any other program already installed on the system.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Affecting the integrity of other programs, including disabling or circumventing security and protection measures, unless the program is doing so at the explicit, informed direction of the user.</li>
                                <li class="con scon" style="font-size: smaller;">Intercepting and redirecting network traffic, unless it is the stated purpose of the software.</li>

                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">The software should not send spam. It should not inject ads, unless that is the stated purpose of the program.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">If the software makes updates, it should provide a clear notification to the user. The user must have a meaningful opportunity to review and approve any principal and significant updates or settings changes.</li>

                            <p class="con lcon" style="color: gray; font-weight: bolder; font-size: xx-large;">Conflict Minerals Policy</p>
                            <p class="con lcon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-large;">Responsible Sourcing of Conflict Minerals</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Background</p>
                            <p class="con scon">Many of our products, like virtually all consumer electronics, contain various metals, including tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (commonly referred to as “3TG”), which originate in mines around the world. The 3TG metals have become known as “conflict minerals” because much of it is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries (together, with the DRC, the “Covered Countries”) where a decades-long civil war is being waged. This conflict has been exacerbated by various groups fighting to control mines and transit routes used in the trade of these minerals.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) requires public companies to file annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission beginning in May 2014, disclosing whether or not they are using 3TG originating from the Covered Countries.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Our Commitment</p>
                            <p class="con scon">We believe it is essential to establish validated, conflict-free sources of 3TG within the Covered Countries so that these minerals can be procured in a way that contributes to economic growth and development in the regions. We believe a widespread withdrawal from trade with the Covered Countries should be avoided. We aim to partner with governmental organizations, industry groups and non-governmental organizations to achieve a workable solution.</p>
                            <p class="con scon">We expect our suppliers to source only from certified conflict-free smelters, such as those audited by the Responsible Mineral Initiative’s (RMI--formerly the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), or another third party assessment program. If we determine that our expectation is not met, we will work with the supplier and the industry to enable conflict-free sourcing. For example, Getforce advises its suppliers to take similar measures with their own sub‐suppliers to ensure alignment and traceability throughout the supply chain and back to the smelter. Furthermore, under the Getforce Supplier Code of Conduct, Getforce expects its suppliers to perform due diligence on the source and chain of custody of minerals used in the manufacturing of products they supply to Getforce. Suppliers’ due diligence measures should be available to us upon request.</p>

                        <p class="con lcon" style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: x-large;">A responsible supply chain isn't just the right thing to do for people and the planet — it's also good for business.</p>
                        <p class="con scon" style="color: gray; font-size: large;">We're committed to minimizing our environmental impact and improving the lives of all people who make our products. We expect the highest ethical standards throughout our supply chain and promote meaningful social change at supplier sites and nearby communities.</p>
                        <p class="con scon" style="color: gray; font-size: large;"> We are working with our suppliers to put in place systems to continually improve their energy performance and scale the deployment of renewable energy sources.</p>
                        <p class="con scon" style="color: gray; font-size: large;">We began our Conflict Minerals program in 2012 to improve transparency in tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold mining and to develop conflict-free sources of these materials.</p>
                        <p class="con scon" style="color: gray; font-size: large;"> We’re always looking for better ways to protect workers and hold suppliers more accountable.</p>

                        <p class="con lcon" style="color: gray; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; font-style: italic;">Community guidelines exist to support the healthy and open discussion that has always been a part of our culture. They help create an environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission and serve our users. Working at Getforce comes with tremendous responsibility. Billions of people rely on us every day for high-quality, reliable information. It’s critical that we honor that trust and uphold the integrity of our products and services. The following guidelines are official policy and apply when you’re communicating in the workplace.</p>
                        <p class="con scon">Here are some key things to remember as you communicate:</p>
                    </div>

                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be responsible.</span> What you say and do matters. You’re responsible for your words and actions and you’ll be held accountable for them.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be helpful.</span> Your voice is your contribution — make it productive.</li>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be thoughtful.</span> Your statements can be attributed to Google regardless of your intent, and you should be thoughtful about making statements that could cause others to make incorrect assumptions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;"> When communicating, follow the three Getforce Values.</li>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Respect the user, respect the opportunity, respect each other. Our Values govern how we conduct ourselves in the pursuit of our mission. We each need to own them personally; we all need to own them collectively.</p>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;">Do your part to keep Getforce a safe, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone.</li>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not. Our primary responsibility is to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Avoid conversations that are disruptive to the workplace or otherwise violate Getforce's workplace policies. Managers are expected to address discussions that violate those rules.</p>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;"> Discussions that make other Getforcers feel like they don't belong have no place here.</li>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Don’t troll, name call, or engage in ad hominem attacks--about anyone. This includes making statements that insult, demean, or humiliate (whether individually or by reference to groups) other employees, our extended workforce, our business partners, or others (including public figures), or that violate other standards of conduct or policies against harassment and bullying.</p>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;"> You are responsible for your words and your reach.</li>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">What you say and do matters and can have lasting impact. Be respectful in your comments about (and to) your fellow Getforcers.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">As a Getforcer, your comments--wherever you make them--can have a serious impact on other Getforcers, yourself and our company. We’re all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company’s activities--that’s part of our culture. Be sure to speak with good information. Don’t assume you have the full story, and take care not to make false or misleading statements about Getforce's products or business that could undermine trust in our products and the work that we do.</p>
                            <li class="con scon" style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;"> Treat our data with care.</li>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Keep in mind that our communications can be rapidly and broadly disseminated. Do not access, disclose, or disseminate Need-to-Know or Confidential information in violation of our Data Security Policy.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">You are responsible for adhering to these guidelines, our Code of Conduct, and other workplace policies. If discussions or behavior don’t align with this policy, managers and discussion owners/moderators are expected to intervene. If necessary we will remove particular discussion forums, revoke commenting, viewing, or posting privileges, or take disciplinary action.</p>
                            <p class="con scon" style="font-size: small;">Subject to local laws and policies, Getforcers and our extended workforce may communicate about pay, hours, other work terms and conditions, or about any violation of law, although they may not publicly disclose confidential information other than as provided by law. <span id="aboutthispolicy"></span></p>
